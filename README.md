# Scheme-Practice-
Scheme Practice Questions that practice lists, hash tables, named lets, and conditionals.
1. addSecond : Adds every second number
2. partner: Randomly assigns a pair of people
3. matchmaker: similar to "partner" but creates pairs from two sets of lists
4. changed: alters a numeric list
5. occurVariant/occur:  gets the number of occurences of input n (an integer), the difference between occurVariant and occur is that "occur" gets all the occurences, while "occurVariant" gets the longest occurence of input n (i.e, no breaks in between)
6. occur2: gets the longest occurence of numbers in a given list
7. fives/addFive: different variations of adding 5 to every number in a list (lambda, recursion)
8. planetPop: a function that gets the planet with the highest population (given list)
9. getMin: gets the minimum number in a list
10. getMax: gets the maximum number in a list
11. hiSort: sorts a list from highest num to lowest num
12. totals: gets the num total of a given person (i.e (Jake 10) (Mona 10) (Mona 15)) --> Mona 25, if given Mona)
13. everyTotal/everyTotal2: gets the num total for every person in a list ("everyTotal" uses the "totals" function, "everyTotal2" doesn't)
14. removal: remove someone from a list
